## Overview

Estimated Cost Summary and Cost Chargebacks help you understand your estimated month-to-date and historical Datadog costs. You can break down your costs by sub-organization and by product.

### Permissions

To view the the Estimated Cost Summary and Cost Chargebacks data, you must be a Datadog Admin user.

Alternately, roles with Billing Read (`billing_read`) and Usage Read (`usage_read`) [permissions][1] can view the Estimated Cost Summary and Cost Chargebacks data.

### Navigation

In the UI, estimated Cost Summary and Cost Chargebacks fall under the [**Plan & Usage**][2] section.
1. In the left navigation, hover over your user name. A pop-up menu appears.
1. Select **Plan & Usage**. 
1. Click the Usage tab.

## Cost summary

Use the cost summary to:
